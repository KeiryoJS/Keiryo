# Contributing to NeoCord.

> *P.S.* The issue tracker is for bug reports and enhancement questions. Anything else, please head to the [discord server](https://discord.gg/5WD9KhF).

If you want to contribute to neocord, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pr when you're done with something. Please do not use a formatter but try to stick to the formatting of other files. 
Prettier will be introduced at a later date, same goes for eslint.
